# Back-end Challenge ๐ 2021


## This is a good API where you can add some users and do some cool sttufs! ;)

### Here our tech stack:

###### ยบ Python
###### ยบ Django
###### ยบ Django Rest Framework
###### ยบ Docker
###### ยบ Poetry
###### ยบ Travis (CI/CD)
###### ยบ Swagger
###### ยบ etc

### How to use:

#### First it all, we'll download the project or clone it.

#### Now, we use `poetry` to do everything inside the project, so, if you dont have it in your machine, download it using this website:

##### - https://python-poetry.org/docs/

#### Now, go inside the project folder and use the command: `poetry install`. This way, you'll install all the dependencis from the project using the poetry. If you have some problems right here, you can email me: atiliogoulart@gmail.com

#### After this, you can use the command `poetry shell` to get in inside the poetry dependencies management. Here you can use all the dependencies that are inside this project and add or remove new dependencies.

### Now, just run the command `python3 manage.py runserver` and enjoy the project! :D


## The project is on my personal github bellow:
